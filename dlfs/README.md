<h3>Deep Learning  Codes From Scratch<h3>

## Purpose

Purpose of this project is to build codes that execute basic deep learning functions. <br>This project is going to offer forward propagation and backward propagation.<br>Of course, forward propagation enable neural networks to predict the output value of input value. Backward propagation will enable neural networnks to learn from taring data set to find optimized weight for prediction proper outcome.

## Requirements
